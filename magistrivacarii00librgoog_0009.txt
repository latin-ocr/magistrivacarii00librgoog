Magistri Vocarir' Summo de Matrimonia. 7

’11111 harmful text about man and woman becoming ‘one fleeh' is
cleverly encountered by another text. From the moment 11 the
marriage, that is, 11111 the moment 11 the tradition, the man has
no power over his own body, or, in other words, his bodyis already
1111 wife's and her bodyis 1111. Therefore this is the moment at
which they become ‘one flesh.' Atthis moment the law makes
them ‘one flesh' by giving to 11111 power over the other's body;
the sexual union 11 mere matter 11 1111. We must distinguish
between the perfectiora 11 1 legal act and the sulfilment 11 obliga·
tione which that act orestes. We must not blur this distinction
by talk about ‘consummation' A marriage is a marriage, and it
cannot become more 11 1 marriage than it already ie.

vacarius 11 prepared to carry this thought into the mystical
sphera 11 sacramentality. The marriage affected by ‘tradition’
already contains the sacrament 11 Christ and the Church. At the
moment 11 dclivery the man and woman are mede ‘one flesh’ by
a vinculum iuria Further, 111 protests against a popular use 11 the
word ratum, which would make it imply indissolubility¹. This use
is, 111 111 thing, nnclassioa13 no single sentence in the Corpus Iuris
Ciuilis sanctiens it. A marriage affected by tradition 111 matri-
monium 1111111111 this it would be even if the law permitted
a divorce a 1111111. We are bidden remember that even aster
the time 11 Christ, even after the time 11 Justinian, divorce was
possible3 St. «Ioseph and St. Mary married undere law that
allowed divorce. Logical to the last, Vacarius will even declara
that the marriages 11 infidele are rata, and contain 1111 sacrament 11
Christ and the Cburch.

Thia attempt 11 make all turn upon the mutual traditio does not
indeed stand quite alone. A similer attempt seems to be made 111
a moment by the author 11 the book that ia known as 1111111111
columnare He is thought to have been a German, to have done
his work about the year 1170 in the province 11 Koln, and to have
beenan adherentes the anti-pope Calixtus. At this point we
shall do well to remember that our Henry Il carried on 1111111111
with the Calixtines, that Reinald von Daasel Archbishop 11 Kc‘ln,

111 quod legali institutione uel prouinciae moribus contrahitur. Hoc inter infideles
ratum non est, quianon est firmum et inuiolabile coniugium eorum!

¹rhe work was described by Schulte, Sitzungsberichte der Wiener dkndemie,
vol. 64, p 93. The relevant passage is given by Scheurl, op. cit p 168, and Freiseu,
111111. p. 189: ‘Item cum in hoo pacto uterque dicat alteri frodo me titi, si verba

Proinde, ex qno sponsa viro tradita et cum ao velata atque traducta est, ex tunc
caro ains viri est, etsi nuptiale mysterium nondum in sa completum 111, 11 hoc
Gratianus post multas ambages sentire videtur!
