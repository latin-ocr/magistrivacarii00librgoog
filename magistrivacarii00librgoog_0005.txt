MAGISTRI VAOARII SUMMA DE MATRIMONIO.

’ Iuruonucrron.

F late years a good deal has been written about Vaearius.
Very recently Dr. liebermann1, to whom the students of
English legal history already owed a heavy debt of gratitude, bas
summed up what is known of the life of this Italian legist and
has added to the sum by calling attention to two works of his
which are lying in manuscript at Cambridge. The one of these
’ is theologiam, the other is devoted to the law of marriage. The
latteris here printed with a few notes. Unfortunately I have
not that knowledge of the canon law which would enable me to
edit this treatise scientifically3 but I believe that I ean give
a fairly correct copy of it, and that it will be of some interest to
a few Englishmen and to a few foreigners.

Of Vacarius himself I will say but very little, since I have
nothing to add to what has been written by Dr. Liebermann and
others in aecessible places ². Only let us remember, first, thatin
all probability he came to England as early as 1148, aud was living
bere as late as 1198 ; secondly, that in tbe meanwhile he had dwelt
under the patronage of Archbishop Theobald of Canterbury and
afterwards of Archbisbop Rogar of York3 tbirdly, that we have
some reason for supposing that his great book, the Summa of
Justinian’s Code, was fiuished in ι 149 ; and fourthly‚ that we have
fairly good evidence of his having taught Roman law in Oxford at
some time in his long career.

The manuscript in question is preserved in the University
Library at Cambridge (li. 3. 9), and its contenta are described at
some length in the printed catalogue (vol. iii. pp. 412-415). For
the more part they oonsist of various works of St. Augustin.
Better judges of handwriting than Ι arn have said that this volume
was compiled near, but rather· before than after, the year 1200. At
the beginning there is a table of contenta which seems to be coeval
with the body of the book. 'l'he portion of this which is most
interesting to us runs aa follows &Augustinus de ayone christiano.
