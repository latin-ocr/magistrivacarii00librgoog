Fspousals by words 01 present time, which are connected if man
and woman express their agreement 10 be frenr henceforth husband
aud wife, constitute a perfect marriage, though the 100111 rarrralir
is necessary 10 introduce into the union tbe sacrament 01 Christ
and His Ohurch. On the other hand, espousals by words of future
time are no marriage; they are butan agreement that there shall
be a marriage hereafter.

Thenceforth there were two main theorias before the world.
Gratian’s was spoken of as the Italian or Bolegnese theory ; Peter's
became the theory 01 the Galliean Ohurch. Warm debates ensued.
Jn particular, about the year 1156, tlre Italian canonist Rufinus
carne forward aa a vehement champion 01 Gratian's cause ¹. But
time was on Peter’s side. His doctrine had the advantage 01
being compatible with 1110 existence 01 1 perfect marriage between
St. Mary and her reputed husband. Pope Alexander Ill, while
he was but Magister Rolandus, had written on 11111 subject, and,
though he accepted Gratian's principles, expressed saure doubt
about the deductione that were drawn from them ². As pope he
went over to Peter’s side, and in the course 01 his long pontificata
settled the law 01 the Ohurch by a'series 01 decisione that were
promulgated in decretal letters. Peter's doctrine that consent per
certa dr 0111011111 constitutas a marriage became the law 01 the
Charch3 but 11 the same time seme traces of the 00001110 theory
were retained, for by ‘consummation' a marriage gained an
additional degree cf indissolubility and perhaps 01 sacramentality.

Now Vacarius has a theory which differs from all 01 these.
The true act of marriage, the act which marks the moment at which
the marriage takes place, is the mutual delivery (11111111) 01 man aud
woman each 10 each. 01 course as a condition there must exist

⁰ 1 0101 01 the appropriate kind. The man delivers himself 11

husband, the woman delivers herself as wif . But 1111 not a mere
expressed consent that makes the marriage; there must be
a delivery, a ‘tradition' figam, as a condition there must be the
natural power of effecting a carnal union; but the carrmlir copula
11 unessentia13 it does not make the marriage; the marriage is made
by the ‘tradition’ Iu a startling passage and by way 01 reductio
ad absurdum Vacarius brings the Bishop 01 Hippo 10 the side 01 the
nuptial couch to upbraid the bridegroom 101 embracing a woman
10 whom he is not yet ‘perfectly’ married. ‘inciuiliter loqueris
Augustine,’ is the man's reply, ‘for she 11 my wife, having become
so by tradition, and the first embrace is as legitinrate as the last'
