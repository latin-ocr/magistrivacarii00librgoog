11 Magistri Vaccrir‘ Samma de Matrimonia

which permite a divorce has been carefully excised¹. Vacarine
quotes, or rather paraphrases the original form 11 the text, but only
in order 11111 he may show that strange things have occasionally
been permitted. Possihly he found the whole canon· in the peges
11 111 11 Gratian'e predecessore, Regino 11 Preme for example, or
Burchard of Wurms ³.

In favour 11 an early date for the book we have not only the
informal manner 111 which the authorities that lie in the Decretum
are cited, and the assumption that the grand marriage question ie

' still open, hut also the 1111 that no notice is taken 11 the epoch-

making decretale 11 Alexander 111⁴. This is the more significant
because one 11 the most decisivo 11 those decretale was seut 11
ruglanda The popes, it 11 true, had hardly as yet made good
their right 11 legislate on a large scale, and the canoniste were still
ready 11 say upon occasion theta pope had gone wrong. We may
fairly suppose, however, that had Vacarius known these Alexandrino
decretale, he would have felt bound either tc hold his peace 1111

controvert 1111111. Magister Rolandue, when he had taken possessionv

11 the chair of St. Peter. was not a man who could be quietly
ig'nored. Unfortunately his pontificato (1159-1181) was long, and
few 11 his decretale hare been dated. Nevertheleee 11 1156 or
thereabouts 11 the earliest <late to which we 1111 attribute this
Summa, the latest date is‚I should suppose, not much 11111.
That ite author was the Vacarius 11 whom all of ue have heard,

and not another person of the same name, seems clear. We know ¹

Vacarius ae 1 legist, and this 11 just such 1 tract as would be
written by 1 legist who for the uouce was making an incursion
into the canonist's territory. Having before his eyes the precision
11 hie own beautiful Digest, he seems to feel 11111 11 pity and
eren contempt for the bonelees serape of exhortatiou and mysticism
that are collected in the Decretum. He complains that the law 11
the Ohurch is always shifting and enselinga He complains
of the canonist’s method. What is the use 11 an attempt to
make a concordance 11 discordant canons when the canons are
discordant⁷l Hie theory 11 marriage, too, ie a legist’s theory.
