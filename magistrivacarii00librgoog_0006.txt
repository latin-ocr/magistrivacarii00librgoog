4 Magistri Voconii Summa dc Matrimonia.

Item eiusdem sermo Mutierarr sortem ¹. item de trinitat. Stemma
dtayt’stri Vacarii de [apparently matrimonio has been erased and
theu a later hand has added aaarrmpto tomice. Item codem [sic] de
matrimonio} 111110111ίί08.Απφιείὶηἱοοηίνα papauer. The pages are
divided into 1110 columns. A little way down in the 1100111 column
on a certain page we find the rubrio Magistri Voyarii tractatis de
cssnrnpto tornius incepit. The treatise that is thus introduced fills
rather more than twenty columns. -Then without interval comes
the rubrio Hic incinit quatum arimino de matrimonio Iltuyistri Vareni,
audon this at once follows our treatise, in thc first words oi which
the writer speaks of himself astho author of 11 opusculum rte assumpto
lomina Our treatise fills rather less than twenty-six columns, and
in the column in which it ceases another brief tract begins with the
words Omnium eapeteotomrm primo eat aspicietis. The writing is good,
andIdo not think that the scribe canbecharged with many mistakes.

The disquisition ‹tc aaarrmpto homimis heralded hy a prefatory
letter3 this will bs printed below by way of appendix. The author
is concerned with ‘the assumption of man' by Christ. He is
making an attack upon what he regards as a fashionable bnt
erroneous philosophy. As Ι understand him, he seeks to prove
that Christ assumed not only the reasonable soul and human dash,

hut also the ‘substance’ of man. The course oi his argument
I dare not attempt to describe. He is angry with certain adversaries
who (so he says) fill the high places in the schools; but he does
not name them. The only writers whom he expressly mentions
are ancisum, such as Angustia, Jeroms, Claudian aud Boethius.
Ι should suppose that he is attacking that doctrine of the 1101111-
tion which is known as N ihilianism, and that his vigorons words
are aimed either at the great Peter Lombard himself or at some
disciples of his who outran their master along a dangerous road2.
They found another enemy in a countryman oi curs, one John of
Oornwall ³, and their doctrine was condemned by Alexander HL
In 11111 case Vacarius seems to have been! fighting on what by its
success was to prove itself to he the orthodox side. It was other·
wisc when he wrote on marriage. Here he championed a lesing
cause, for this same Alexander dealt its death-hlow ⁴.

¹ This, it 1111111111111 comes not from Augustis, but from Beda.

⁴ In the prefnce to the Dc assumpto tremine the haud of the cirilian seems to be
betrayed when its author says, ‘Cum lege cautum sit nullam esse interpretati 111111
gustantum valeat ut preiudicars possit manifesto sensui! I have not, however,
been able to truce the original this maxim. ·
