acting in pursuanee of a mandate srorn Innocent ΙΙ(1130-1143).
This mandate apparently supposed that some sort of formal ‘tradi-

< tion’ of Alhreda by her father had taken place, but that William

had never removed her from her father's house, and it was admitted
that there had been no eeclesiastioal ceremony and no sexual inter·
course. Nevertheless, Innocent decreed that if there had been
a consent to he thenceforth husband and wife, there had been a
marriage, and that the subsequent union with Adelicia, though
solemnly celebrated in ehurch and hlessed with offspring, was
adulterans. Iu short, Innocent seems to have acted upon the
theory of marriage which is now generally coupled with the name
of Peter Lomhard ¹. Now this was just such a case as would have
set Vacarius a·writing his pamphlet There might be a pact hy
.‘words of present time‚' but was there a marriage if Albreda was
left under her lather's roof ²2 . Ofteu what looks like a speculation
of abstraot jurisprudence hasbeen the outeome of a concrete law-
suit‚ and is none the worse lor having its origin in real facts. This
is only a guess3 hut the temptation to connect together two men
so famous in our legal history as the first teaeher of Roman law
and the heroic English litigant was not to he withstood.
