Magistri Vocaric' Siccrcmc de Matrirooocb. 5

The tract on marriage may apeak for itself. Ι must not
presumo to comment upon it at any length, nor endeavour pre·
cisely to fix its place in the important controversy to which it
belongs. In tha main it will ιο intelligible to any one who will
read a few modern books and keep a copy of the Decretum
Gratiani open before him ¹. But two or three explanatory remarks
I will venture to make. ’

In tha middle of the twelfth century the Ohurch throughout the
Westcm world was successfullyclaiming for her courts arr exclusive
right ιο prenounca on the validity of marriagcs. But in truth she
was not aa yet equipped with any doctrine of wedlock sufficiently
definite ιο serve as elagel theory. A few brief texts in the Bible;
a few passages in the werke of tha Fathers‚ some of which were
but too mysticat while others were but too hortative; afew canons
and decretale that were not very consistent with each other—these
were the unsatisfactory materiale out of which law was to be
made. And the law wae to bc cosmopoliten. The very nature of
the claim tc treat marriage as a spiritual matter, a divinely
ordained institution, prevented the Church's lawgivers and lawyers·
from laying a decisivo strecs upon any ritas or usages that were
merely national. A cosmopolitan law of marriage cannot make
any ceramony or formality essential. It must composa its marriage
out of those elementa which wc ean conceive as common ιο ιιο
marriages of all people in all agee, such as the agreement to marry,
the beginning of cohabitation, and the sexual union. Difficulties
which in any ease would have been great were complicated by the
supposed necessity of proving that marriage is in some sort-but
who shall say what sorti-a recrementum, and of giving the name
of marriage ιο such union as the Christian legend would allow
St. «Ioseph ιο contraot with the Bleased Virgin.

Gratian(oirc.1139-4a) made a determincd endeavour to obtain
a musistent theory out of the materiale that hc collected ². He
holds that ιιο maurulio, the agreement to marry hereafter‚ con-
stitute an ‘initiate marriage,' which however only becomes a ‘con-
summate marriage ’ at the moment of physical intercourse. Were
we ιο translate hie doctrine into modern terme, we should say that

really there is no marriage until such intercourse has taken place, s

though from this principle ha would not draw all the infercnces that
would be drawn from it by modern law. About the sometime
Peter Lombard³ was developing a new distinction, the famous
