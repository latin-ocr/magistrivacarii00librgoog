who was the soul of the schism, visited our shores, and that Roger
of Pont l’liveqne¹ Archbishop of York‚ was both the patron ol
Vacarius and the rival and enemy ol' Becket ¹. Some intercourse
between Vacarius and the German canonist is not out of the
question.

We may well think that the doctrine of Vacarius had much to
commend it. On the one hand, it cannot have stood very remote
from Germanic custom, while on the other, it was not out of
harmony with the usage described in the Digest‚ for though some
would teach us nowadays that the Roman marriage became iu
theory a merely consensual and formless transaction, still un·
doubtedly great strecs was laid on the delectio ia domum as being
the usual and almost necessary evidence of a marriage. Also it
was much in the vein of our own ancient lawyers that some change
of ‘seisin‚’ some traditio vel qumi (as Vaearius calls it), should be
regarded as the act of marriage. However, unfortunately for the
Ohurch and unfortunately ior the world, the Cbnrch's law oi
marriage took¹ a different turn. The voice ol Vocarius is Vos
clamantia in decerto. To this may be due the fact, if fact it be, that
his voice is transmitted to us hy an unique manuscript.

At another point he opposes the triumphant doctrine of the
canonista. A young girl who is in the power of parents or
guardians cannot ΒΘ married without their comant If that be not
given, there will ΒΘ ΒΘ marriage, but at best a contubernium. He
accuses his adversaries-and here he has both Gratian aud Peter
Lomhard against him—of frittering away the clear words of Pope
Evaristus² (mol-109 l). Those words we now know to ΒΘ the
words of the Pseudo-Isidore⁸. Neither Vacarius nor his foes knew
that, and in his eyes they are guilty of eluding a plain decree of
a pope who was learned ia atroque iore. Here again he had
morality‚ decency‚ ancient law, and the remote future for allies ;
but the current of sacramentalism was too strong to be atemmed.

That he had Gratian’s work before him seems quite plain,
though he never names Gratian nor the Decretum. ΑΒΘ we may
infer that the Decretum was still new and had not yet established
itself as the one classical text-hook of the canon law, for though
he quotes many os the ‘authorities’ that are contained in it, and
also quotes some of the dicio Gratiani, he never mentions any
‘distinction‚' ‘cause’ or ‘question,' as assuredly he would have
donchad he been writing near the end ol the twellth century.
