Magistri Vacorc'i Summo cic Matrimonii. 11

It may not be just that which modern scholare will discover in
Justinian's books, but it brings marriage into line with the con-
veyance of property. Other legal transactione, such as donation
and partnerehip‚ are constantly belore his mind, and in his eyes
a word from Pomponius is enough to sweep away a lot of foolish
talk about matrimonia which are and malamorta which are not radr'.
We should hardly be going too far were we to say that this is
a civilian’s protest against the moss'that is being made of the law
of marriage by canonisis and divinos. We might like, perhaps, to
go further and to contrast an Oxonian with the Bolognese and with
the Parisian theory of marriage, and thus to unite in one story the
three great universities of the twelfth century. But we have no
warrant for this. Vacarius’s pamphlet (for it is no more) is no
scheol-book comparabis with the Decretum and the Sentencee, and,
lor anything that we know, may represent the opinion of one
solitary and protesting legist. That its author was both daring
and acute is plain.

Another gaesa ie inriting. Il we attribute this tract to the
years which closely follow 1156, we give it to a time when England
and Rome, Normandy and Gasoony were witnesses to the dogged
litigiousness of that immortal plaintiff, Richard of Anesty².
Baginning his long suit in 1158, he triumphed in1163. He had
the professional aid of another Italian lawycr, whose 'name has
elsewhere³ been coupled with that of Vacarius, namely, of Master
Ambross⁴. Is it impossible that if Magister Ambrosius was ol
counsel for the plaintiff, Magister Vacarius was retained for the
defencel Or again, if in 1159 vacarius still remained an inmate
of Archbiehop Theobald's household, we can hardly doubt that he
was consulted about a case which raised nice questions of matri·
monial law and tasked the wisdom of the archiepiscopal court to
its uttermost. One of these questions was whether a divorse
pronounced in Stephen’s reign hythe legate Henry ol Blois was
valid. In Henry I’s day one William had, so some asserted, married
Albreda, while others maintained that this was no marriage and

. that at a later date he had married Adelicia. In Anesty’s suit

Archbishop Theobald's secretary‚ John of Salisbury (to whom
Vacarius was ‘Vaearius noster’ and from whom we learn oi
Stephen’s attempt to silence the voice of Roman law), reported to
Alexander ΙΠ the story ol these would-be marriages and the
subsequeut divorce. He said that the former marriage was upbeld
and the nullity of the second declared by Henry of Blois, who was
