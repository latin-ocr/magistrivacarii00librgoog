Whether he had before him tha ‘Paleaa' that is, the passages

inserted in the Decretum by Gratian's pupil Paucapalea¹, seems
more doubtful. He quotes two passages that are thus introduced3
but from this it does uot follow that they stood in his copy of the
Decretum. Το one oi these two he repeatedly² alludes, but, whereas
iu the manuscripts which are the base of the modern editions of
Gratian'a book this text 11 ascribed to Augustin ³, Vacarius attri-
butes it to Pope Hormisda (1.1). 514-523). It is a passage which
appears also, and under Augustin's name, in the Compilatio Prima⁴
and in the Decretals of Gregory 121⁶.

With the theory of marriage stated by Peter Lombard our
author was familiam bnt I cannot say that he takes any words
from the Parisian schoolman, nor (11 Ι 111 any proof that he had
read the Summa of Paucapalea‚ the Summa of Roland, or the
Summa of Stephen of Tournay. On the other haud, it is pretty
plain that he horrowed phrases from and directed much oi his
argument against Rufinus. This, ii Dr. von Schulte is right, would
allow us ιο assigu his treatise ιο any year after 1156 ⁶.

If we place out oi account the two ‘Paleas’ which have been
already mentioned, Ι believe that he cites hut two other ‘authorities’
which he could not haye obtained from the Decretum. (1) The
first of these⁷ is a sorged letter of Alexander, pope and martyr,
that 1111 Α111111111Ι(1191-1191). This appears in the Summa
oi Rufinus ⁸, also in the Summa of Johannes Faventinus⁹, also in
the Collectioiipsiensis ¹⁰. It is a forged decretal, but it 11 not one
of the Pseudo-Isidorian broad. No more seems to he certainly
known of it than that it became current in the twelfth century.
Not impossibly it was connected in the course oi the controversy
about marriage in order to support the Bolognese against the
Parisian theory. (a) The second of these two authorities ¹¹ is
acanon of the Gonnoil ol verberis, held in the year 753. This in
its original 1111111111 in the form iu which Vacarius knew it,
distinctly contemplatae the possibility of a true divorce in our
sense of the term: that isto say, in a certain case a man whose
wife will not follow him into a foreign country is allowed to marry

μ another. Part of this canon appears in the Decretum, but the part
